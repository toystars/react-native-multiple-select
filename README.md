## Usage
Note: Ensure to add and configure [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) to your project before using this package.

You can clone and try out the [sample](https://github.com/toystars/RN-multiple-select-sample) app.

The snippet below shows how the component can be used


```javascript
// import component
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import MultiSelect from 'react-native-multiple-select';

class MultiSelectExample extends Component {

  this.state = {
    selectedItems = [];
  };

  this.items = [{
    id: '92iijs7yta',
    name: 'Ondo',
  }, {
    id: 'a0s0a8ssbsd',
    name: 'Ogun',
  }, {
    id: '16hbajsabsd',
    name: 'Calabar',
  }, {
    id: 'nahs75a5sg',
    name: 'Lagos',
  }, {
    id: '667atsas',
    name: 'Maiduguri',
  }, {
    id: 'hsyasajs',
    name: 'Anambra',
  }, {
    id: 'djsjudksjd',
    name: 'Benue',
  }, {
    id: 'sdhyaysdj',
    name: 'Kaduna',
  }, {
    id: 'suudydjsjd',
    name: 'Abuja',
  }];

  onSelectedItemsChange = selectedItems => {
    this.setState({ selectedItems });
  };

  render() {
    const { selectedItems } = this.state;
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <MultiSelect
          hideTags
          items={items}
          uniqueKey="id"
          ref={(component) => { this.multiSelect = component }}
          onSelectedItemsChange={this.onSelectedItemsChange}
          selectedItems={selectedItems}
          selectText="Pick Items"
          searchInputPlaceholderText="Search Items..."
          onChangeInput={ (text)=> console.log(text)}
          altFontFamily="ProximaNova-Light"
          tagRemoveIconColor="#CCC"
          tagBorderColor="#CCC"
          tagTextColor="#CCC"
          selectedItemTextColor="#CCC"
          selectedItemIconColor="#CCC"
          itemTextColor="#000"
          displayKey="name"
          searchInputStyle={{ color: '#CCC' }}
          submitButtonColor="#CCC"
          submitButtonText="Submit"
        />
        <View>
          {this.multiSelect.getSelectedItemsExt(selectedItems)}
        </View>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

```

The component takes 3 compulsory props - `items`, `uniqueKey` and `onSelectedItemsChange`. Other props are optional. The table below explains more.


## Props

| Prop        | Required   | Purpose  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| altFontFamily | No      | (String) Font family for `searchInputPlaceholderText` |
| canAddItems | No      | (Boolean) Defaults to "false". This allows a user to add items to the list of items provided. You need to handle adding the new items in the onAddItem function prop. Items may be added with the return key on the native keyboard. |
| displayKey | No | (String) Defaults to "name". This string will be used to select the key to display the objects in the items array |
| fixedHeight | No     | (Boolean) Defaults to false. Specifies if select dropdown take height of content or a fixed height with a scrollBar (There is an issue with this behavior when component is nested in a ScrollView in which scroll event will only be dispatched to parent ScrollView and select component won't be scrollable). See [this issue](https://github.com/toystars/react-native-multiple-select/issues/12) for more info. |
| filterMethod | No | (String) Defaults to  "partial". options: ["partial", "full"] Choose the logic on how the system filters items based on searchTerm. partial: checks all individual words and if at least one word matches will include that item. full: checks to ensure the item contains the full substring of searchterm in order minus any leading or trailing spaces.
| flatListProps | No | (Object) Properties for the FlatList. Pass any property that is required on the FlatList of the dropdown menu |
| fontFamily | No     | (String) Custom font family to be used in component (affects all text except `searchInputPlaceholderText` described above) |

Here you should ensure that the new items are added to your provided list of `items` in addition to any other consequences of new items being added. |

| onSelectedItemsChange | Yes      | (Function) JavaScript function passed in as an argument. The function is to be defined with an argument (selectedItems). Triggered when `Submit` button is clicked (for multi select) or item is clicked (for single select). (Check sample above) |

## Note

- Tokenized selected items can be displayed in any other part of the view by adding a `ref` to the `MultiSelect` component like so `ref={(component) => { this.multiSelect = component }}`. Then add this to any part of the screen you want the tokens to show up: `this.multiSelect.getSelectedItemsExt(selectedItems)`. The `selectedItems` argument passed into the above mentioned method is the same `selectedItems` passed as the main component selected items prop. (See example above).

- If users shouldn't be able to select any of the items in the dropdown list, set a `disabled` key to true in the item. Such item will be rendered in gray and won't be clickable.

- When using the `single` prop, `selectedItems` should still be passed in as an array of selected items keys. Also, when an item is selected in the single mode, the selected item is returned as an array of string.

- The `items` props must be passed as an array of objects with a compulsory `name` key present in each object as the name key is used to display the items in the options component.

- filterMethod partial example: searchTerm = "University of New" will return "University of New York", "University of New Orleans", "The University of New York" as well as "University of Columbia" and "New England Tech" due to partial matches.

- filterMethod full example: searchTerm = "University of New" will return" University of New York", "University of New Orleans", "The University of New York" because all three contain the substring "University of New"

### Removing all selected items

To use, add ref to MultiSelect component in parent component, then call method against reference. i.e.

```javascript
<MultiSelect
  ref={c => this._multiSelect = c}
  ...
/>

clearSelectedCategories = () => {
   this._multiSelect._removeAllItems();
};

```
